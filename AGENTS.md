# AGENTS.md — KSF FrontAccounting Architecture Notes

Operational memory for the KSF FA infrastructure codebase. Files live under
`~/Documents/ksf_Infrastructure/fa_modules/`. This doc captures cross-module
architecture **decisions** and findings. Read this before designing or
refactoring anything that spans modules.

> **Companion doc:** `AGENTS_ARCH.md` (co-located, hardlinked into each repo)
> holds the shared module **conventions** and cross-repo engineering standards
> (module layout, coding/testing standards, dev/deploy workflow, inter-module
> hook protocols, security-area registry, FA DB gotchas). This file holds only
> decisions.

## Cross-module facts (at a glance)

- **PHP 7.3 is the cross-module compatibility floor** (current prod runs 7.3 on
  Fedora 30 until a web container is stood up; the FA container runtime is 7.4).
  See `AGENTS_ARCH.md` §1.
- **ksf_FA_Common is now a pure Composer/Packagist package** (v1.0.9), not an FA
  module. It was gutted to a no-op module shell. Owning modules (RBAC, CRM,
  Calendar, HRM, Assets) register/unregister their `ksf_contact_types` on
  activate/deactivate via embedded `sql/retag_contact_types.sql`.
- **Square**: composer.json `config.platform.php = 7.4.33` pinned (commit
  `b0ef4da`) for the PHP 7.4 container; lock regeneration is blocked locally on
  the private `ksfraser/import-staging` package.
- **FA_ProductAttributes issue #52 (child not detected as read-only)** root cause
  found: two parallel, un-unified parent-relationship mechanisms (see below).

## The "generic data-dictionary + query-builder" direction (active design)

The user wants a **generic, transport-agnostic** data-dictionary + SQL query
builder package (suggested name `ksf_common_db`), NOT another DB class, and NOT
in `ksf_FA_Common` (whose naming is FA-module-specific). Core requirement:

> An interface defines the SQL query commands. A translation layer maps them to
> MySQL commands when outside FA, and to FA's procedural `db_*` functions when
> inside FA, so the correct implementation can be DI'd.

Requirements/goals captured from discussion:
- Want the **data dictionary + query builder** capabilities (from the legacy
  `ksf_modules_common` `MODEL`/`fa_MODEL` framework).
- **No third parallel DB-class abstraction** on top of what exists.
- Lifecycle (pre/post CRUD) hooks should be able to tie into this system.
- Package should be usable standalone (tests, CLI, other frameworks), not just
  inside FA.

### The pattern ALREADY exists / is partially realized (critical to not rebuild)
1. **RBAC's `DbAdapterInterface` + `FaDbAdapter` (now generalized)** — the exact
   two-part interface→FA-translation pattern the user described: `fetchAssoc`, `fetchAll`,
   `executeUpdate`, `lastInsertId`. `FaDbAdapter` substitutes `?` placeholders via
   `mysqli_real_escape_string` (FA has NO prepared statements) and regex table prefixing.
   This served as the proof of concept and has been **genericized into the
   `ksfraser/ksf-common-db` package** (`ksfraser\CommonDb\Contract\DbConnectionInterface` /
   `ksfraser\CommonDb\Adapter\FaDbAdapter`); the RBAC-local copies were deleted. See that
   package's `APPENDIX.md` for the migration.
2. **Legacy `ksf_modules_common` (procedural, older)** — the actual data-dictionary +
   query-builder the user remembers:
   - `class.MODEL.php` — `fields_array` + `table_details['tablename']`/`['primarykey']`
     dictionary; clause builders `buildSelect/From/Where/Join/GroupBy/Having/OrderBy/Limit`
     assembled by `buildSelectQuery()`; CRUD `select_row`, `select_table`,
     `insert_table`, `update_table`, `delete_table`, `ReplaceQuery`, `create_table`,
     `alter_table`; `define_table()` derives tablename from class name + company prefix.
   - `class.fa_MODEL.php` — FA subclass; sets `company_prefix = TB_PREF`.
   - `class.eventloop.php` — Observer pattern event dispatcher: `ObserverRegister`,
     `ObserverNotify` (with `'**'` wildcard = all), subscribers implement `notified()`.
   - **CAVEAT**: the `eventloop` Observer hooks are wired only for `NOTIFY_INIT_TABLES`
     → `create_table` and logging. They are NOT wired into `insert_table`/`update_table`/
     `delete_table` as pre/post CRUD points. The `tell_eventloop(..., "NOTIFY_LOG_*", ...)`
     calls are largely logging noise.
3. **Modern ksf_FA_Common traits (OOP, current recommendation for hooks)**
   - `src/Traits/WorkflowHooksTrait.php` — SuiteCRM-style lifecycle hooks. Register a
     record type → hook prefix via `registerWorkflowType($recordType, $hookPrefix)`.
     `fireWorkflowHook()` builds `{prefix}_{hookKey}` and calls `hook_invoke_all(...)`.
     Hook keys: `before_save`, `after_save`, `before_delete`, `after_delete`, `new`,
     `edited`, `linked`, `unlinked`. Convenience dispatchers + `fireWorkflowHooks()`
     runs the full ordered sequence.
   - `src/Traits/CrudOperationsTrait.php` — `createRecord()` / `deleteRecord()` wrappers
     that fire pre-save → create → new/edited → post-save (and pre-delete → delete →
     post-delete), delegating the actual DB work to overridable `*Internal()` methods.
   - Both live in `ksfraser\FrontAccounting\Common\Traits\` (namespace is FA-flavored).
   - Adoption is currently minimal: ksf_FA_Common's own unit tests +
     `ksf_FA_HRM/hooks.php`. Not yet rolled out module-wide.

### Naming observation
The `registerWorkflowType($recordType, $hookPrefix)` + `{prefix}_{operation}` scheme
already achieves what the user proposed as "DB class reads `$table_name` to build
pre/post hook name." `$table_name` should map to a hook **prefix**, not be the literal
hook name. Per-table hooks use `hook_invoke_all` (module-oriented dispatcher from
`includes/hooks.inc`) — consistent with FA, zero new infra. If literal table-derived
names are wanted, add a small table→prefix mapper, don't build a new dispatcher.

### PDO question (decided: YES, PDO is the standalone impl; FA uses its own adapter)
FA's DB layer is mysqli-based, NOT PDO (`includes/db/connect_db_mysqli.inc` uses
`mysqli_connect/query/insert_id/errno/fetch_row`; procedural `db_query`/`db_escape`/
`db_fetch_assoc`/`db_insert_id` wrappers; FA has NO prepared statements).

Design: **make PDO the consumer contract of the interface, not the transport.** Two
implementations of one `DbConnectionInterface` (PDO-style ops: query, executeWithParams,
fetchAll, fetchAssoc, insertId, quote, beginTransaction/commit/rollBack):
- `PdoDbAdapter` (standalone: tests/CLI/other frameworks) — nearly a 1:1 PDO wrapper,
  real prepared statements, multi-driver.
- `FaDbAdapter` (inside FA) — maps each method to FA `db_*`/mysqli calls, resolves
  `?`/`:name` placeholders to escaped literals (FA has no prepared statements), exactly
  like the FA adapter in `ksf-common-db` (`mysqli_real_escape_string` binding + regex
  prefixing).

**HARD RULE (user directive): FA modules MUST use native `db_*` calls at runtime.**
PDO is ONLY for the standalone/portable side (tests, CLI, non-FA embedding). The FA
adapter is the single, mandatory implementation inside FA and must delegate every
operation to FA's procedural `db_query`/`db_escape`/`db_fetch_assoc`/`db_insert_id`/
`db_num_rows`/`db_error` etc. — never a PDO handle, never raw mysqli. PDO is the
portable *contract shape*, not a runtime transport for FA. (Note: PDO is an optional
for the FA side: the only reason to depend on it at all is standalone usage; the FA
adapter itself needs no PDO.)

PDO and FA never meet; they are alternative DI implementations of a shared contract.
This satisfies the user's requirement: "interface that translates SQL to MySQL outside
FA but `db_*` inside FA so the right classes can be DI'd." This is realized by the
`ksf-common-db` package's `DbConnectionInterface` + `FaDbAdapter`/`PdoDbAdapter`.

### ksf_common_db package — implemented
The `ksfraser/ksf-common-db` package (namespace `ksfraser\CommonDb`) exists at
`~/Documents/ksf_common_db`, is published on Packagist (`v1.0.0`), and RBAC has
been migrated onto it. **Repo-specific implementation/packaging/migration/gotcha
notes live in that repo's `APPENDIX.md`** — see there for structure, consumers'
dependency convention, the RBAC migration, and the implementation gotchas. This
section only records the shared design decisions.

Structure (high level):
- `src/Contract/DbConnectionInterface.php` — PDO-shaped contract: `fetchAssoc`,
  `fetchAll`, `fetchScalar`, `executeUpdate`, `lastInsertId`, `quote`, `beginTransaction`,
  `commit`, `rollBack`. Accepts `?` (positional) or `:name` (named) placeholders.
- `src/Adapter/FaDbAdapter.php` — FA runtime adapter; native `db_*` only.
- `src/Adapter/PdoDbAdapter.php` — native PDO + prepared statements (NOT for FA runtime).
- `src/Dictionary/TableDefinition.php` — data dictionary + CREATE/INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE SQL.
- `src/Query/QueryBuilder.php` — fluent parameterized SELECT builder.

NEXT STEPS (cross-module): port other modules' DAOs onto `DbConnectionInterface` +
`TableDefinition`/`QueryBuilder`, then wire the pre/post workflow hooks
(`WorkflowHooksTrait`/`CrudOperationsTrait` from ksf_FA_Common) onto the DAO layer.

## FA core hook system (reference)

`includes/hooks.inc`:
- `hook_invoke($ext, $method, &$data, $opts)` / `hook_invoke_all($method, &$data, $opts)`
  / `hook_invoke_first` / `hook_invoke_last` — dispatch to `$Hooks` extension objects.
- Transaction-level DB hooks exist: `hook_db_prewrite`, `hook_db_postwrite`,
  `hook_db_prevoid` → `hook_invoke_all('db_prewrite'|'db_postwrite'|'db_prevoid', $cart,
  $type)`. These are CART/transaction scoped (sales orders, invoices, etc.), NOT
  per-row CRUD. Per-row CRUD hooks are not provided by core; they come from the
  traits/adapters above.

## FA_ProductAttributes issue #52 root cause (verified)

Two parallel, un-unified parent-relationship mechanisms:

| Concern | `product_hierarchy` (via `ProductAttributesDao`) | `product_attribute_assignments.parent_stock_id` (via `VariationsDao`) |
|---|---|---|
| Writes | `setProductParent($child,$parent)` (INSERT…ON DUP UPD / DELETE) | `setParentRelationship()` (called by `CreateChildAction`) AND `addAssignment(...,$parentStockId)` |
| Reads | `getProductParent()` — **used by `VariationsTab` for `$isChild` detection** | `getProductVariations()`, `isVariation()` |
| Populated on CreateChildAction? | **NO** — nothing calls it | **YES** |

- `VariationsDao::setParentRelationship()` (VariationsDao.php:334) writes
  `product_attribute_assignments.parent_stock_id`.
- `ProductAttributesDao::setProductParent()`/`getProductParent()`
  (ProductAttributesDao.php:392/416) write/read `product_hierarchy`.
- `CreateChildAction::handle()` calls `variationsDao->setParentRelationship($childId,
  $stockId)` (CreateChildAction.php:88) but NEVER `setProductParent()`.
- `VariationsTab::renderTabContent()` sets `$isChild = !empty($this->dao->getProductParent($stockId))`
  (VariationsTab.php, ~line 51-54) and renders read-only + hides buttons when child.
- Net: generated children (`auto-gas-L-11-36-Ind` etc.) are registered only in
  `product_attribute_assignments`, so `product_hierarchy` is empty for them →
  `getProductParent()` returns null → `$isChild` false → read-only protection never
  engages → issue #52/#45 reproduce.
- `product_hierarchy` DOES get rows when someone manually sets a parent via the
  Product Types UI (`UpdateProductTypesAction`, `ProductAttributesTabController`).

Fix implications: the create-child path must also write `product_hierarchy` (call
`setProductParent`), OR the tab's child detection must fall back to
`product_attribute_assignments.parent_stock_id` / `isVariation()`.

## SQL prefix / install conventions (from earlier work)

- SQL files use a hardcoded `0_` prefix — FA `db_import` does NOT resolve
  `@TB_PREF@`. PHP code uses the `TB_PREF` constant. Documented in
  `ksf_FA_Common/MODULE_DIRECTORY.md` §Table Prefix Convention.
- Assets module SQL convention: `update_databases()` paths are relative to `sql/`
  (uses `'install.sql'`, not `'sql/install.sql'`); others prefix with `sql/`.
- Retag/contact-type ownership SQL lives inside each owning module's `sql/`
  (`retag_contact_types.sql`), idempotent, wired into `activate_extension()`'s
  `$updates`. Never in an external checklist.

## Cross-module contracts principle

- Any ksf module must be standalone; class availability must never be gated on
  another module's activation state.
- Cross-module contracts/classes live in a Packagist package (e.g. ksf_FA_Common /
  future ksf_common_db), NOT in a module dir.
